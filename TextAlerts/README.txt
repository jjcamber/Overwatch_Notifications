Unfinished but working

1. Pin Overwatch to a consitent spot on your taskbar and use a script or app like Mouse Pos to get the pixel coordinates of your screen on the Overwatch icon on your taskbar, just to the right of the actual art icon, the blank area where it will blink orange.
   Alternatively, use the other color and coordinates of the middle of your screen offset to the left about half way if you want to stay tabbed into Overwatch and not get notificaitons when it's minimzed. Input the coordinates into the code.

2. Register an app password with your gmail account if you have a gmail account with 2FA, or use a your normal password.

3. Fill in your phone number with the correct carrier at the end.

4. Run the app to recieve text message alert when you find a game :)
